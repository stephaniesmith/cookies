# Project Name

## Overview
This is my week 2 project for Bootcamp 1 at Alchemy Code Lab. I'm building this application to get better at HTML, CSS, & Javascript. 

In this project I made a public-facing website for the fictional store Pat's Salmon Cookies. I also built a sales site that keeps track of cookies sold at different location, the users can update the table with as they acquire more information. 
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) Also a good idea to include a link to a deployed or live version of your project. -->

## Getting Started
Look around the public-facing site to get to know Pat's Salmon Cookies better. On the sales site use the from to update the information and see how many cookies are being sold in each location.
